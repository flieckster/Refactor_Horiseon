# Refactor_Horiseon

Refactor of website named Horiseon. 

I updated several elements of the HTML and CSS. Removing some ID, and replacing with Class elements. in the CSS class elements were repeating as if they were ID's so I consolidated them into a few class elements to streamline the css. I added several notes to the HTML so its easier to see what the code blocks are. In fixing the class id's that were linked to the CSS to common classes, i had to create ID tags in the H2 headers of the article so that the Navigation links would still work. I updated Div's to articles, and aside tags also. I even updated the webiste title to the name of the company as it was missing.
